# design plan

My plan is to create a rough preliminary design for each module. After I have an idea of how every module will interact with each other,
I will begin looking for specific chips to use and start on a to scale design using some form of pcb software. After I have worked out
every detail regarding propigation time, voltages ect ect, I will begin ordering parts and boards, and test my computer module by module.
Once every module has been tested, and all revisions have been made, I will put all of the modules together and test the final product.



Please note that the red connections in this design symbolize four separate connections, and blue connections indicate separate connections.



Connections going off to different modules are placed perpendicular to a red or blue wire 
and are color coded.

Green: control unit
Dark Yellow: ALU
purple: interrupt module
orange: data-bus
